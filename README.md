# Powerlifting app 
Still searching for a proper name, but I'm making this so that I can easily keep track of my workouts without needing a physical book.

## Setup
 - You will need to make sure you are set up to run React Native apps.  Follow the steps [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) to get your machine set up to run the app.
    - Follow the steps for both iOS and Android until you get to the `Create a new application` step.
 
 ## Running the App
 - Run `yarn`/`yarn install` to install the dependencies
 - `yarn start` to start the local server
 - `yarn ios | android` to run the respective OS 

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome; however, since I'm still getting this set up, there isn't a lot that can be done.

I will be using React Testing Library for Unit Tests, and [Detox](https://github.com/wix/Detox) for the E2E tests.
